    "A vineyard owner is planting several new rows of grapevines, and needs to know how many grapevines to plant in each row. She has determined that after measuring the length of a future row, she can use the following formula to calculate the number of vines that will fit in the row, along with the trellis end-post assemblies that will need to be constructed at each end of the row:The terms in the formula are:V is the number of grapevines that will fit in the row.R is the length of the row, in feet.E is the amount of space, in feet, used by an end-post assembly.S is the space between vines, in feet.Write a program that makes the calculation for the vineyard owner. The program should ask the user to input the following:\n",
